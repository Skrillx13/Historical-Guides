# Historical guides

???+ warning "This website is still a Work In Progress"

    This website is under construction, meaning pages will be missing content, and the site may have 404 page errors. I promise the site will be out by Saturday Morning (I hope).

## What this is/Intro

A Documentation site to host History notes. Here you can find notes for the Secondary 2 history syllabus, and some old presentations we still have in stock. More content to come soon. Notes created by Ian Chang, and website developed by Jonathan Fong.

## Getting Started

Simply navigate using the tabs on the site, or you can use the scearch bar to find a specific page/topic. For a contribution guide, navigate to Extras. Other things such as credits can be found in the Others tab.

## Roadmap
- [x] Secondary 2 syllabus being worked on 

❌ All of our old presentations

❌ Other historical content
