## Dealing with Shortages

The war disrupted trade, which limited import of goods to Singapore from overseas. Furthermore, most of Singapore's remaining resources were chanelled to Japan's war efforts.

During the first weeks of the Japanese occupation, essential food items were strictly rationed. Purchasing cards were used to indicate the amount of rice each household could buy in a week.

The shortage of items resulting in something known as inflation, the rate of increase in prices over a given period of time. People had to pay extremely high prices for basic necessities, so the Japanese goverment responded by pringing more banana notes (The currency during Japanese occupation), resulting in the value of banana notes dropping. At the end of the Japanese occupation, the notes were amost worthless.
