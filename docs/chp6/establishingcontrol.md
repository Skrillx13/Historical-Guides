Basically, the Japanese used a bunch of toruture methods to impose control on the locals. Methods used were typically gruesome, although this is not the case for every method you see:

## Meting Out Harsh Punishments

This method was used to control the case of looting. Looters were caught and decapitated , their heads being displayed for all to see as an example to others. This was meant to instil fear and induce fear into the populace by showing the consequences of going against the japanese.

Although this was for mainly captivating 
The main perpetrator was the Kempeitai( Japanese military police). They actively encouraged tip offs and telling on disloyal elements to them in exchange for monetary and food incentives/rewards.This fostered mistrust in society with no one trusting each other.

## Imprisoning Allied Soldiers

Both soldiers and civilians were imprisoned to prevent revolt from happening. Even women and children were not spared, and thrown into captivity.

Allied prisoners would be forced to walk from Bukit Timah Road to Changi Prison and the nearby barracks, where they were imprisoned. While walking, many civlians would pass the POWs food and money, despite the risk of being caught and being punsihed.

## Operation Sook Ching 

This is a pretty long section, but I will just summarize it, and add a flowchart for easier referance.

This was a operation meant to identify and root out elements that they felt would prove a threat to the Japanese occupation. This was mainly targeted at the chinese population, as many were actively supporting the Chinese resistance against Japan back in China be it through terms of fund raising or volunteers. 

All men between the ages of 18 to 50 were mandated to be present for screening , a masked informant would have done the selection. People such as secret society members, former civil servants or journalists were checked throroughly, as they had the skills to resist againts the Japanese.

If you were not identified as being anti-Japanese, you would receive a rectangular stamp, and be allowed to leave. This stamp shows you have been interogated, and allows you tyo be further questioned by the Japanese.

However, if you were identified as being anti-Japanese, you would receive a triangular stamp, and be tied up, and kept under guard. You would then be transported to beaches in Punggol, and be executed. Japanese records say that around 6000 people were killed, but other estimates say it's closer to around 25,000 to 30,000.

## Winning Loyalty

The Japanese attempted to win loyalty through using Propaganda. These cam in the form of films, radio programs, and posters.

They portrayed the Japanese in a good light, and attempted to dehumanize the British, and tried to convince the locals that joining Japan was beneficial to them. Supported independence movements such as backing the Indian independence movement by Chandra Bose (Fun Fact: The Nazis also had something similar to this, also by Chandra Bose).

They also attempted to win loyalty by providing benefits to locals, such as providing free education by giving over 20000 textbooks to students in 1944.

Ethnic groups were also treated favourably. Examples include Malays being treated last harshly than other races, salt, sugar, and rice being distributed to the less fortunate during Hari Raya Puasa and Malay and Indian were charged lesser tolls at the crossway. 

## Imposing Japanese Culture

This was pursued as the Japanese assumed that Japanese values and way of life would be imbued to the locals. They did so by changing the curriculum of schools. 

They also inculcated the Japanese spirit in students by imposing nippon seishin or the Japanese spirit, this was done so as to foster a sense of unity and loyalty. This was done by learning the Japanese anthem, bowing to a picture of the emperor and learning folk songs. Exercise was also imposed so as to instil discipline amongst the students.
